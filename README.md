# XraySuspects

XraySuspects aims to integrate into Paper's anti-xray mechanisms, efficiently utilizing server resources to monitor and flag suspicious activities related to x-ray usage and only allowing Paper's antixray to be used against suspects.

## Warning

While this plugin *may* optimize resource usage, please note that the performance impact of AntiXray modules or this plugin can be significant. The most effective anti-xray measures often involve discouraging players from using such cheats rather than solely relying on AntiXray.

Be aware that exposing ores to users can potentially allow them to exploit seed anti-xray strategies, even if anti-xray features are enabled later. It is recommended to implement additional protection measures against such exploits.

## Installation

1. Ensure that the permission for world anti-xray configuration is enabled.
2. Download the plugin and place it in the `plugins` folder of your Paper server.
3. Add the Paper anti-xray bypass permission to your default group to enable functionality.
4. Configure the plugin according to your server's requirements.
